This a an demo about how to use tts(text-to-speech) making a avatar speak just like a human.

There is a free tts service on azure

At first step,  I make the model to speak out what the user input in the textaera.
second step, I want to use chatgpt to make the model talk to user.

I think it is an interesting demo.
